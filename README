                   Project 1: A gentle introduction to Minix

   This assignment has several parts. In the first part, students need to
   setup a Minix environment. It is recommended that students use a Minix
   virtual machine (VM). In the remaining parts, students will edit Minix
   source and compile a new Minix3 image. The specifics for these parts
   follows.

Part A: VMM and Minix3

   The VCL image for Minix3 is being constructed.

   Students may elect to install a VMM on their own machines. This will
   likely prove very useful, even if the VCL image is the primary development
   platform. The recommended virtual machine monitor is [2]VMware Server,
   which can be [3]downloaded for [4]free. Instructions for installing VMware
   and Minix3 are given in [5]this message board post.

   Students may use a different VMM. Such examples include, but are not
   limited to, [6]VirtualBox, [7]Xen, [8]Qemu, and [9]Bochs. The last two are
   technically emulators, meaning the performance will be much less than with
   a VMM.

  Requirements

   Students must produce a Minix command prompt from their own installation.

   This part will not be graded explicitly. However, it is a necessary step
   to for the other parts.

Part B: OS_VERSION

   Students will change the version of a Minix installation. There is a
   constant, OS_VERSION, that holds the version string. It is "1.2a" by
   default.

  Requirements

   Make the OS version be "1.2" followed by your Unity ID.

   You need to edit /usr/src/include/minix/config.h and recompile the kernel.
   To recompile and install execute "make install" from the /usr/src/
   directory.

   Two things that should occur. First, there should be a new image in
   /boot/image. In my case the image is: /boot/image/3.1.2vwfreeh. You can
   execute this new image by running the "reboot" command. This will execute
   the most recent image in the /boot/image directory. The name of the OS
   version will be displayed when it boots. If you miss it type: "grep
   /usr/log/messages". Or alternatively, you can execute "uname -a". However,
   this only prints 5 characters.

Part C: getty

   Change the startup banner for tty.

   Edit the file getty.c. Add the characters "CSC246: " (include the space)
   to the banner. After you recompile and install, the banner on each tty
   should begin:

     CSC246: Minix Release ...

  Requirements

   System outputs the proper tty banner.

Part D: Information Server

   The IS (information server) is special Minix process that provide
   information about the running kernel. One feature it supports is printing
   information at the press of an F-key. Try pressing Shift-F5.

   The file /usr/src/servers/is/dmp.c Contains code that maps F-keys to
   functions. Modify this file to call a routine you created to display your
   Unity ID when the F8 key is pressed.

  Requirements

   F8 key displays student's unity ID
