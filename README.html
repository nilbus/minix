<h1>Project 1: A gentle introduction to Minix</h1>
<p>
  This assignment has several parts.
  In the first part, students need to setup a Minix environment.
  It is recommended that students use a Minix virtual machine (VM).
  In the remaining parts, students will edit Minix source and 
  compile a new Minix3 image.
  The specifics for these parts follows.
  </p>

  <h2>Part A: VMM and Minix3</h2>

  <p style="background-color:pink">The VCL image for Minix3 is being constructed.</p>
  <p>Students may elect to install a VMM on their own machines.
  This will likely prove very useful, even if the VCL image is the
  primary development platform.
  The recommended virtual machine monitor is
  <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">VMware Server</a>,
  which can be
  <a href="http://www.vmware.com/download/server/getserver.html">
  downloaded</a> for
  <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.09/posts.html?pg=6">free</a>.
  Instructions for installing VMware and Minix3 are given in
  <a href="http://wolfware.ncsu.edu/wrap-bin/mesgboard/csc:246::001:1:2009?task=ST&Forum=0&Topic=1" >this</a>
  message board post.
  </p>
  <p>Students may use a different VMM.
  Such examples include, but are not limited to,
  <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" >VirtualBox</a>,
  <a href="http://www.xen.org/" >Xen</a>,
  <a href="http://bellard.org/qemu/" >Qemu</a>, and
  <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/" >Bochs</a>.
  The last two are technically <i>emulators</i>, meaning the
  performance will be much less than with a VMM.
  </p>
<blockquote style="background:lightgrey">
  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>Students must produce a Minix command prompt from their own installation.</p>
</blockquote>
  <p>
  This part will not be graded explicitly.
  However, it is a necessary step to for the other parts.
  </p>

  <h2>Part B: OS_VERSION</h2>
<p>Students will change the version of a Minix installation.
There is a constant, <tt>OS_VERSION</tt>, that holds the version
string.
It is &quot;1.2a&quot; by default.
  </p>
<blockquote style="background:lightgrey">
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Make the OS version be &quot;1.2&quot; followed by your Unity ID.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to edit <tt>/usr/src/include/minix/config.h</tt> and
recompile the kernel.
To recompile and install execute &quot;make install&quot; from the
<tt>/usr/src/</tt> directory.
</p>

<p>Two things that should occur.
First, there should be a new image in <tt>/boot/image</tt>.
In my case the image is: <tt>/boot/image/3.1.2vwfreeh</tt>.
You can execute this new image by running the &quot;reboot&quot;
command.
This will execute the most recent image in the <tt>/boot/image</tt>
directory.
The name of the OS version will be displayed when it boots.
If you miss it type: &quot;grep <unityid> /usr/log/messages&quot;.
Or alternatively, you can execute &quot;uname -a&quot;.
However, this only prints 5 characters.
</p>

<h2>Part C: getty</h2>

<p>Change the startup banner for tty.</p>

<p>Edit the file <tt>getty.c</tt>.
Add the characters &quot;CSC246:&nbsp;&quot; (include the space) to
the banner.
After you recompile and install, the banner on each tty should begin:
<blockquote>
CSC246: Minix  Release ...
</blockquote>
</p>
<blockquote style="background:lightgrey">
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>System outputs the proper tty banner.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Part D: Information Server</h2>
<p>The IS (information server) is special Minix process that provide
information about the running kernel.
One feature it supports is printing information at the press of an
F-key.
Try pressing Shift-F5.
</p>
<p>The file <tt>/usr/src/servers/is/dmp.c</tt>
Contains code that maps F-keys to functions.
Modify this file to call a routine you created to display your Unity
ID when the F8 key is pressed.
</p>
<blockquote style="background:lightgrey">
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>F8 key displays student's unity ID</p>
